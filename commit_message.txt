[Cursor] Navigation simplification & global styles consolidation

- Simplified navigation to only Home and Blog pages
- Deleted unnecessary pages: about, portfolio, solutions, contact, book
- Consolidated all unique styles into app/globals.css including:
  * Page layout styles (backgrounds, containers)  
  * Typography styles (gradients, headings)
  * Animation styles (glow trail from contact page)
  * Card and form styles
  * Blog/prose styles
  * Badges, lists, icons, and utilities
- Updated all navigation components to use simplified structure
- Fixed hover effects with proper CSS classes
- Enhanced blog page with graceful Contentful error handling
- Removed unused API route: app/api/contact/route.ts
- Updated .cursorrules with progress documentation

All functionality preserved globally while simplifying site structure.
