# Chat Widget Integration Guide

This document outlines the integration of the n8n chat widget with our Next.js application, providing detailed setup instructions, configuration options, and troubleshooting tips.

## Overview

The chat widget provides a seamless way for users to interact with our support team through an AI-powered interface. It uses n8n workflows to process messages and generate responses.

Key features:
- Real-time chat interactions
- Session management to maintain conversation context
- Customizable theming to match the website design
- Support for various response formats
- Mobile-friendly design

## Environment Variables

The chat widget requires the following environment variable:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAT_WEBHOOK_URL=your_n8n_webhook_url
```

You can find this webhook URL in your n8n instance under the workflow you want to connect to. It should look something like:
```
https://your-n8n-instance.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/chat
```

Optional environment variables:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAT_API_KEY=your_api_key  # If your n8n webhook requires authentication
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Configure Environment Variables

1. Add your n8n webhook URL to your `.env.local` file:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAT_WEBHOOK_URL=your_n8n_webhook_url
   ```

2. If no environment variable is set, the widget will fall back to a default URL (defined in the component).

### 2. Component Implementation

The chat widget is implemented in `app/components/ChatWidget.tsx` and includes:

- Custom styling to match our site's theme
- Automatic message customization
- Header and avatar customization
- Click-outside detection to close the chat panel
- Aggressive style overrides to ensure consistent appearance

### 3. Integration with Layout

The chat widget is already included in the main layout file (`app/layout.tsx`), making it available throughout the application:

```tsx
// In app/layout.tsx
import ChatWidget from "@/app/components/ChatWidget"

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      {/* ... other layout elements ... */}
      <body>
        {/* ... site content ... */}
        
        {/* AI Chat Widget */}
        <ChatWidget />
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

> **Note:** You do not need to add the ChatWidget component to any other pages or components, as it's already globally available through the root layout.

## n8n Workflow Setup

To create an n8n workflow that works with the chat widget:

1. **Create a new workflow in n8n**:
   - Log in to your n8n instance
   - Create a new workflow
   - Name it something like "Website Chat Bot"

2. **Add a Webhook node**:
   - Add a new "Webhook" node as the trigger
   - Configure it with the following settings:
     - Authentication: None (or Basic Auth if you're using an API key)
     - HTTP Method: POST
     - Path: `/chat` (or any other path you prefer)
     - Response Mode: Last Node

3. **Add a JavaScript node** to parse the incoming message:
   ```javascript
   // Example code to process incoming messages
   const inputData = $input.item.json;
   
   // Extract the message, session ID, and other data
   const message = inputData.message || '';
   const sessionId = inputData.sessionId || 'unknown_session';
   const timestamp = inputData.timestamp || new Date().toISOString();
   const source = inputData.source || 'unknown';
   
   // Log the incoming message (optional)
   console.log(`Received message from ${source}: "${message}" (Session: ${sessionId})`);
   
   // Return the data for the next node
   return {
     json: {
       message,
       sessionId,
       timestamp,
       source
     }
   };
   ```

4. **Add your chatbot logic**:
   - This could be a simple Switch node for basic responses
   - Or connect to OpenAI, Anthropic, or other AI services
   - You could use a Database node to store conversation history

5. **Add a final Set node** to format the response:
   ```javascript
   // Simple response format
   return {
     json: {
       message: 'This is my response to your message'
     }
   };
   
   // OR more complex format with multiple messages
   return {
     json: {
       messages: [
         'This is my first response',
         'And here is some follow-up information'
       ]
     }
   };
   ```

6. **Activate the workflow** and copy the webhook URL:
   - Save your workflow
   - Activate it using the toggle in the top-right
   - Copy the generated webhook URL from the Webhook node
   - Add this URL to your environment variables

## Response Format

The chat widget supports multiple response formats from the n8n webhook:

1. **Simple string**:
   ```json
   "This is a simple text response"
   ```

2. **Object with message**:
   ```json
   {
     "message": "This is a response message"
   }
   ```

3. **Object with type and content**:
   ```json
   {
     "type": "text",
     "content": "This is the content of the message"
   }
   ```

4. **Array of messages**:
   ```json
   {
     "messages": [
       "This is the first message",
       "This is the second message"
     ]
   }
   ```

## Customization Options

### Visual Customization

The following elements can be customized:

- Chat bubble appearance
- Panel header
- Message styling (user and bot)
- Input area
- Initial messages
- Avatar images

### Behavioral Customization

You can modify:

- Bot name
- Initial message
- Message delay
- File upload capabilities
- Chat history persistence

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Chat widget not connecting to n8n**
   - Verify the webhook URL is correct in your .env file
   - Check n8n instance is running and accessible
   - Check browser console for connection errors (look for logs with üîó and ‚öôÔ∏è emojis)
   - Verify the workflow is activated in n8n

2. **Styling issues**
   - Inspect the DOM to see if custom styles are being applied
   - Check if the style element with ID 'n8n-custom-styles' exists in the DOM
   - Verify there are no errors in the browser console related to styles

3. **Custom messages not appearing**
   - Check if the message observer is working correctly
   - Verify the initial message configuration
   - Check n8n workflow for proper response formatting

4. **Brain emoji still appearing in header**
   - Make sure your browser cache is cleared (the header customization might be cached)
   - Check if the header title customization code in ChatWidget.tsx is being executed
   - Verify that there are no conflicts with the n8n chat configuration

5. **No response from webhook**:
   - Check the n8n execution logs
   - Verify the workflow is processing the message correctly
   - Ensure the response format is supported

6. **Error messages in console**:
   - Look for specific error messages in the browser console
   - Check for network errors in the Network tab
   - Verify the webhook URL is accessible from the browser

### Debugging Tips

- Use `console.log` statements in the ChatWidget component to trace execution
- Monitor network requests to the n8n webhook
- Check n8n execution logs for errors in the workflow
- Use browser devtools to inspect the rendered chat widget elements

## Advanced Configuration

For advanced customization, you can modify:

1. **Translations**: Update the messages in different languages
2. **Message Formatting**: Implement custom message rendering
3. **Integration with Backend**: Connect the chat to your own APIs
4. **User Identification**: Track and identify users across sessions

### Session Management

- The chat widget generates a unique session ID for each visitor
- This ID is passed with each message in the `sessionId` field
- Use this in your n8n workflow to maintain conversation state

### Message Format

- All messages sent to the webhook include:
  - `message`: The user's message text
  - `sessionId`: Unique session identifier
  - `timestamp`: ISO timestamp of the message
  - `source`: Set to 'website_chat' to identify the source

### Authentication

- If you enable Basic Auth on your webhook, set the API key in your environment
- The key will be sent as a Bearer token in the Authorization header

## Security Considerations

- Webhook URLs should be treated as sensitive information
- Consider implementing rate limiting in your n8n workflow
- Be careful about what information is logged or stored from chat conversations
- Implement proper data handling procedures for any user information collected

## Deployment Considerations

When deploying to production:

1. Set the correct environment variables for each environment
2. Ensure proper error handling
3. Monitor the n8n instance for stability
4. Consider scaling requirements for high traffic periods

## Updates and Maintenance

The n8n chat widget is periodically updated. To update:

1. Check the current version against the latest release
2. Update the script source URL if necessary
3. Test thoroughly after updates
4. Note any breaking changes in the release notes
