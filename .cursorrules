# Instructions

During your interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the `.cursorrules` file so you will not make the same mistake again. 

You should also use the `.cursorrules` file as a Scratchpad to organize your thoughts. Especially when you receive a new task, you should first review the content of the Scratchpad, clear old different task if necessary, first explain the task, and plan the steps you need to take to complete the task. You can use todo markers to indicate the progress, e.g.
[X] Task 1
[ ] Task 2

Also update the progress of the task in the Scratchpad when you finish a subtask.
Especially when you finished a milestone, it will help to improve your depth of task accomplishment to use the Scratchpad to reflect and plan.
The goal is to help you maintain a big picture as well as the progress of the task. Always refer to the Scratchpad when you plan the next step.

# Tools

Note all the tools are in python3. So in the case you need to do batch processing, you can always consult the python files and write your own script.

[NOTE TO CURSOR: Since no API key is configured, please ignore both the Screenshot Verification and LLM sections below.]
[NOTE TO USER: If you have configured or plan to configure an API key in the future, simply delete these two notice lines to enable these features.]

## Screenshot Verification

The screenshot verification workflow allows you to capture screenshots of web pages and verify their appearance using LLMs. The following tools are available:

1. Screenshot Capture:
```bash
venv/bin/python3 tools/screenshot_utils.py URL [--output OUTPUT] [--width WIDTH] [--height HEIGHT]
```

2. LLM Verification with Images:
```bash
venv/bin/python3 tools/llm_api.py --prompt "Your verification question" --provider {openai|anthropic} --image path/to/screenshot.png
```

Example workflow:
```python
from screenshot_utils import take_screenshot_sync
from llm_api import query_llm

# Take a screenshot

screenshot_path = take_screenshot_sync('https://example.com', 'screenshot.png')

# Verify with LLM

response = query_llm(
    "What is the background color and title of this webpage?",
    provider="openai",  # or "anthropic"
    image_path=screenshot_path
)
print(response)
```

## LLM

You always have an LLM at your side to help you with the task. For simple tasks, you could invoke the LLM by running the following command:
```
venv/bin/python3 ./tools/llm_api.py --prompt "What is the capital of France?" --provider "anthropic"
```

The LLM API supports multiple providers:
- OpenAI (default, model: gpt-4o)
- Azure OpenAI (model: configured via AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT in .env file, defaults to gpt-4o-ms)
- DeepSeek (model: deepseek-chat)
- Anthropic (model: claude-3-sonnet-20240229)
- Gemini (model: gemini-pro)
- Local LLM (model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-AWQ)

But usually it's a better idea to check the content of the file and use the APIs in the `tools/llm_api.py` file to invoke the LLM if needed.

## Web browser

You could use the `tools/web_scraper.py` file to scrape the web.
```bash
venv/bin/python3 ./tools/web_scraper.py --max-concurrent 3 URL1 URL2 URL3
```
This will output the content of the web pages.

## Search engine

You could use the `tools/search_engine.py` file to search the web.
```bash
venv/bin/python3 ./tools/search_engine.py "your search keywords"
```
This will output the search results in the following format:
```
URL: https://example.com
Title: This is the title of the search result
Snippet: This is a snippet of the search result
```
If needed, you can further use the `web_scraper.py` file to scrape the web page content.

# Lessons

## User Specified Lessons

- You have a python3 venv in ./venv. Use it.
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- Due to Cursor's limit, when you use `git` and `gh` and need to submit a multiline commit message, first write the message in a file, and then use `git commit -F <filename>` or similar command to commit. And then remove the file. Include "[Cursor] " in the commit message and PR title.

## Cursor learned

- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
- Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration
- When using seaborn styles in matplotlib, use 'seaborn-v0_8' instead of 'seaborn' as the style name due to recent seaborn version changes
- Use 'gpt-4o' as the model name for OpenAI's GPT-4 with vision capabilities

## Git Branching Workflow

### Branch Types
1. main (Production)
   - Always stable and deployable
   - Direct commits not allowed
   - Changes come only through PR merges from dev
   - Protected branch requiring PR reviews

2. dev (Development)
   - Main development branch
   - Feature branches merge here first
   - Used for preview deployments
   - Must pass tests before merging to main

3. feature/* (Feature Branches)
   - Created from dev branch
   - One branch per feature
   - Format: feature/descriptive-name
   - Merged back to dev when complete

### Pull Request Templates

1. Feature Branch to Dev:
   ```markdown
   Title: [Cursor] Feature Description
   Base: dev
   Compare: feature/your-feature-name
   
   ## Changes
   - List specific changes made
   - One change per line
   - Be specific and clear
   
   ## Testing
   - List what was tested
   - Include preview deployment checks
   - Note any specific test cases
   
   ## Notes
   - Any additional context
   - Breaking changes if any
   - Dependencies or requirements
   ```

2. Dev to Main (Production):
   ```markdown
   Title: [Cursor] Merge dev into main for production
   Base: main
   Compare: dev
   
   ## Changes
   - List all features being promoted to production
   - Note any major updates or changes
   - Reference related PR numbers if applicable
   
   ## Testing
   - Confirm all changes verified in dev
   - List preview deployments tested
   - Note any specific production considerations
   
   ## Notes
   - Any deployment requirements
   - Breaking changes if any
   - Required environment variables
   ```

### Workflow Steps
1. Starting New Feature
   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git pull origin dev
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Working on Feature
   - Make commits with clear messages
   - Push regularly to remote
   - Keep branch up to date with dev

3. Completing Feature
   - Push final changes
   - Create PR to dev branch
   - Get review and approval
   - Merge to dev
   - Delete feature branch

4. Production Release
   - Create PR from dev to main
   - Review deployment preview
   - Get final approval
   - Merge to main

### Checkpoints for Branch Management
I will help manage these git operations at these key points:
1. When starting new feature work
2. When feature implementation is complete
3. When merging to dev branch
4. When preparing for production release
5. When hotfixes are needed

### Common Commands
```bash
# Update dev branch
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/name

# Update feature branch with dev
git checkout feature/name
git merge dev

# Push changes
git push origin feature/name

# Clean up after merge
git branch -d feature/name
```
