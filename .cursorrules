# Instructions

During your interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the `.cursorrules` file so you will not make the same mistake again. 

You should also use the `.cursorrules` file as a Scratchpad to organize your thoughts. Especially when you receive a new task, you should first review the content of the Scratchpad, clear old different task if necessary, first explain the task, and plan the steps you need to take to complete the task. You can use todo markers to indicate the progress, e.g.
[X] Task 1
[ ] Task 2

Also update the progress of the task in the Scratchpad when you finish a subtask.
Especially when you finished a milestone, it will help to improve your depth of task accomplishment to use the Scratchpad to reflect and plan.
The goal is to help you maintain a big picture as well as the progress of the task. Always refer to the Scratchpad when you plan the next step.

# Tools

Note all the tools are in python3. So in the case you need to do batch processing, you can always consult the python files and write your own script.

[NOTE TO CURSOR: Since no API key is configured, please ignore both the Screenshot Verification and LLM sections below.]
[NOTE TO USER: If you have configured or plan to configure an API key in the future, simply delete these two notice lines to enable these features.]

## Screenshot Verification

The screenshot verification workflow allows you to capture screenshots of web pages and verify their appearance using LLMs. The following tools are available:

1. Screenshot Capture:
```bash
venv/bin/python3 tools/screenshot_utils.py URL [--output OUTPUT] [--width WIDTH] [--height HEIGHT]
```

2. LLM Verification with Images:
```bash
venv/bin/python3 tools/llm_api.py --prompt "Your verification question" --provider {openai|anthropic} --image path/to/screenshot.png
```

Example workflow:
```python
from screenshot_utils import take_screenshot_sync
from llm_api import query_llm

# Take a screenshot

screenshot_path = take_screenshot_sync('https://example.com', 'screenshot.png')

# Verify with LLM

response = query_llm(
    "What is the background color and title of this webpage?",
    provider="openai",  # or "anthropic"
    image_path=screenshot_path
)
print(response)
```

## LLM

You always have an LLM at your side to help you with the task. For simple tasks, you could invoke the LLM by running the following command:
```
venv/bin/python3 ./tools/llm_api.py --prompt "What is the capital of France?" --provider "anthropic"
```

The LLM API supports multiple providers:
- OpenAI (default, model: gpt-4o)
- Azure OpenAI (model: configured via AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT in .env file, defaults to gpt-4o-ms)
- DeepSeek (model: deepseek-chat)
- Anthropic (model: claude-3-sonnet-20240229)
- Gemini (model: gemini-pro)
- Local LLM (model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-AWQ)

But usually it's a better idea to check the content of the file and use the APIs in the `tools/llm_api.py` file to invoke the LLM if needed.

## Web browser

You could use the `tools/web_scraper.py` file to scrape the web.
```bash
venv/bin/python3 ./tools/web_scraper.py --max-concurrent 3 URL1 URL2 URL3
```
This will output the content of the web pages.

## Search engine

You could use the `tools/search_engine.py` file to search the web.
```bash
venv/bin/python3 ./tools/search_engine.py "your search keywords"
```
This will output the search results in the following format:
```
URL: https://example.com
Title: This is the title of the search result
Snippet: This is a snippet of the search result
```
If needed, you can further use the `web_scraper.py` file to scrape the web page content.

# Lessons

## User Specified Lessons

- You have a python3 venv in ./venv. Use it.
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- Due to Cursor's limit, when you use `git` and `gh` and need to submit a multiline commit message, first write the message in a file, and then use `git commit -F <filename>` or similar command to commit. And then remove the file. Include "[Cursor] " in the commit message and PR title.

 feature/mobile-and-navigation

## Cursor learned

- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
- Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration
- When using seaborn styles in matplotlib, use 'seaborn-v0_8' instead of 'seaborn' as the style name due to recent seaborn version changes
- Use 'gpt-4o' as the model name for OpenAI's GPT-4 with vision capabilities

## Git Branching Workflow

### Branch Types
1. main (Production)
   - Always stable and deployable
   - Direct commits not allowed
   - Changes come only through PR merges from dev
   - Protected branch requiring PR reviews

2. dev (Development)
   - Main development branch
   - Feature branches merge here first
   - Used for preview deployments
   - Must pass tests before merging to main

3. feature/* (Feature Branches)
   - Created from dev branch
   - One branch per feature
   - Format: feature/descriptive-name
   - Merged back to dev when complete

 main

## Recent Lessons
- Always merge feature branches to dev first for testing
- Keep content management separate from code changes
- Use Squash and Merge for cleaner git history
- Verify branch location after PR completion
- When dealing with Resend API, ensure "from" email addresses use properly verified domains
- Cloudflare Email Routing is only one-way (forwarding), not for sending emails
- Form elements must have matching id attributes for their htmlFor label connections
- Always add autocomplete attributes to form inputs for better accessibility and user experience
- Use "off" for autocomplete on sensitive fields or custom fields that don't fit standard categories

## Cursor learned

- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
- Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration

# Debugging and Reasoning Framework

## Core Debugging Principles

1. Systematic Analysis:
   - Map system components and dependencies
   - Document data flows and state changes
   - Identify potential bottlenecks
   - Note architectural boundaries
   - Track system assumptions

2. Problem Decomposition:
   - Explain issues in plain language
   - Use "Five Whys" technique
   - Document reproduction steps
   - Map error propagation paths
   - Identify trigger conditions

3. Solution Strategy:
   a) Immediate Actions:
      - Quick validations
      - Logging enhancements
      - Error handling checks
      - State verification
      - Resource monitoring

   b) Tactical Improvements:
      - Targeted refactoring

   ```

9. Information Validation:
   - Verify version compatibility
   - Check for deprecations
   - Review breaking changes
   - Note compatibility issues
   - Document findings

## Reasoning Process
[STRUCTURED THINKING - Required for complex issues]

10. Uncertainty Phase:
   - Acknowledge complexity
   - List unknowns

### Current PR Information
For feature/copy-updates:
```markdown
Title: [Cursor] Update portfolio page copy and content structure
Base: dev
Compare: feature/copy-updates

## Changes
- Updated CTA section text with more compelling messaging
- Improved text formatting for better readability
- Added emphasis on urgency and competitive advantage
- Updated .cursorrules with new project guidelines

## Testing
- Verified text changes in portfolio page
- Checked responsive layout

### Next Feature Branch
After PR is merged:
- Name: feature/mobile-and-navigation
- Base: dev (after copy-updates is merged)
- Scope: 
  1. Button functionality implementation
  2. Call-to-action button links
  3. Mobile optimization

## Testing Best Practices
- Always test new features in local development environment first
- Only deploy to production after thorough local testing passes
- Never use production environment as a testing ground
- Distinguish between expected development warnings (e.g. CSP, hot reload) and actual functionality issues
- Local development testing provides:
  - Faster iteration on fixes
  - Safe environment for debugging
  - Access to development tools and logs
  - Prevention of accidental production data manipulation
- When encountering warnings/errors:
  1. Identify if it's a development-only warning
  2. Verify if it affects core functionality
  3. Test the actual feature behavior regardless of warnings
  4. Document which warnings can be safely ignored
